### Why did I make the app

I was playing Minecraft with my friends and I had to update the local server. I had to move a bunch of files and I thought why not automate it. I was bored, so I decided to do it

You can refer to this guide if you want to do this process manually https://wiki.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/how-to-update-server-minecraft#:~:text=In%20a%20Nutshell%3A,executable%20from%20the%20official%20website.

Have fun playing Minecraft <3
