# Minecraft-Server-Update-App (Java version)

Application to update a local Minecraft server to the latest server version

## Description

### Version 1

The Process of updating the local Minecraft server isn't a complex process but an arduous one. This app helps you update your local minecraft server to the latest version.

## How to get started

- Download the latest Minecraft server from https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server
- Place in a new folder and run the server.jar file (This will be the target folder)
- Copy the path of the folder that contains the current server (This will be the origin folder)

## How to run the app

- Make sure the .bat file and The MinecraftServerUpdate.jar are in the same folder
- Change the Origin folder path and Target folder path in the .bat file (make sure to paste them within the doble quotes)

### Why did I make the app

I was playing Minecraft with my friends and I had to update the local server. I had to move a bunch of files and I thought why not automate it. I was bored, so I decided to do it
